/**
 * Extension class of {@link MobEffect}. Acts as the base for all effects and functions in this library. <br>
 * Note that the additional methods added here are also pass-throughs for the vanilla methods where applicable.
 * This will cause some parameters to be marked with {@code @Nullable} where they would not be able to be provided when passing through.
 * This should only occur when another mod is calling the vanilla methods, which should almost never happen. <br>
 * In the event it does however, it might be worth falling back to a default behaviour for best compatibility. Until Forge or Mojang fixes MobEffects themselves, this is the best we can do.<br>
 * <br>
 * An alternate approach this would have been to inject this into MobEffect directly via interface, however that doesn't actually offer any functional benefit, and it eliminates the possibility of marking <i>final</i> on the now-unused vanilla methods.
